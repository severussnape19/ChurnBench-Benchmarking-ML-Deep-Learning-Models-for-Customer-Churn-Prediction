# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
This project is all about understanding what causes telecom customers to leave, and building models to predict churn more accurately. I experimented with a wide range of deep learning and machine learning techniques — not just to find the "best" model, but to learn how architecture choices, optimizers, and loss functions impact real-world metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.

# What I Explored
* Built 7 different ANN architectures

* Tried 6 optimizers (Adam, SGD, RMSprop, etc.)

* Used both BCELoss and BCEWithLogitsLoss

* Trained 42 deep learning models and 8 machine learning models

* Compared models using precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves

* Did some EDA to explore key features that impact churn (like tenure, contract type, etc.)

# Final Model Analysis

>I created a separate notebook to compare the top 3 models from ML and DL. I included radar charts, heatmaps, and final score visualizations to see how they stack up. I also added a short note on the business impact of false positives vs false negatives — to justify why I chose the final model.

# Key Takeaways

* Accuracy isn’t everything — especially with imbalanced data like churn.

* The right optimizer or loss function can make a big difference.

* Structuring the notebook with dropdowns and hidden cells made it easier for me to track what I did and why.

# Why Churn Prediction Matters
Churn prediction helps companies identify which customers are at risk of leaving, so they can take action early. It's a real business problem with real impact — and building models for this gave me hands-on experience in tackling imbalanced classification and thinking beyond accuracy.
