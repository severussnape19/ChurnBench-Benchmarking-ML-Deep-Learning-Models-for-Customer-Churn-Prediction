In this notebook, I visualized and compared the performance of selected classical machine learning (ML) models and deep learning (DL) models on a customer churn dataset.

My initial goal was to work with a slightly more complex dataset and experiment with neural network techniques such as LeakyReLU, Dropout, Sigmoid, Binary Cross-Entropy (with and without logits), and Batch Normalization.

However, this project turned into one of the most valuable learning experiences I've had so far. I encountered and debugged several issues, deepened my understanding of model evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and explored new visualization tools like ROC Curves and Radar Charts.

I also got to learn better pre-processing techniques using ColumnTransformer, which streamlined my workflow when handling categorical and numerical features.

Overall, this project gave me practical insight into how both ML and DL models behave on real-world structured dataâ€”and how to evaluate them beyond just accuracy.
